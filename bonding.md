# Bonding

## What is bonding?

**Bondig is the secondary value accrual strategy of Olympus.** Bonds are a cross
between a fixed income product, a futures contract, and an option. The protocol
quotes the bonder with terms for a trade at a future date. These terms include a
predefined amount of OHM the bonder will receive and the time when vesting is
complete. The bond becomes redeemable as it vests. I.e. in a 5 day term, after 2
days into the term 40% of the rewards can be claimed.

**Bonding is an active, short-term strategy.** The price discovery mechanism of
the secondary bond market renders bond discounts more or less unpredictable.
Therefore bonding is considered a more active investment strategy that has to be
monitored constantly in order to be more profitable as compared to staking.

**Bonding allows Olympus to accumulate its own liquidity.** We call our own
liquidity [POL](./glossary.md#pol). More POL ensures there is always locked exit
liquidity in our trading pools to facilitate market operations and protect token
holders. Since Olympus becomes its own market, on top of additional certainty
for OHM investors, the protocol accrues more and more revenue from LP rewards
bolstering our treasury.
