### APR

Annual Percentage Rate, is the annualized interest rate without taking the
effect of compounding into account.

### APY

Annual Percentage Yield, is the normalized representation of an interest rate,
based on a compounding period over one year. Note that APYs provided are rather
ballpark level indicators and not so much precise future results.

### BCV

Bond Control Variable, is the scaling factor at which bond prices change. A
higher BCV means a lower discount for bonders and less inflation by the
protocol. A lower BCV means a higher capacity for bonders and less profit for
the protocol.
