# OlyZaps

OlyZaps allows you to exchange (zap) any assets into sOHM or a bond in a single
operation. This is convenient for users who want to take a position quickly.

## How to Zap into sOHM

1. Go to the OlyZaps page.

enter an amount.

for this transaction**.

4. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, click "Zap-Stake"
and sign the transaction. **You need to pay gas again for this transaction**.

5. Your sOHM balance should be updated once the zap operation is successful. If
you cannot find sOHM in your wallet, please add the [sOHM contract address](../contracts/tokens.md#sohm)
to your wallet.

The "Approve" transaction is not needed when you zap from the *same token* next
time.
