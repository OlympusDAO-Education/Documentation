# Stake LP Tokens

Staking LP tokens on OlympusDAO allows you to earn OHM passively. Each day, a fixed amount of OHM will be distributed among the stakers based on their pro rata share of staked LP tokens.

## How to Stake LP Tokens

1. Go to Sushiswap and add liquidity for the [OHM-DAI pool](https://app.sushi.com/add/0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F/0x383518188C0C6d7730D91b2c03a03C837814a899). If you do not know how to do so, there is a good guide on [SushiSwap documentation](https://help.sushidocs.com/guides/how-to-add-tokens-to-sushiswap-exchange-as-an-lp).

2. Go to the [LP Staking page of the OlympusDAO website](https://olympusdao.finance/#/lpstake). Select the "Stake" tab.

3. Type in the amount of SLP you would like to stake, then click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

4. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, click "Stake" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have staked your SLP tokens!
