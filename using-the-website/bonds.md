# Bonds

Bonds allow users to buy OHM from the protocol for a discount by trading it for liquidity \(SLP Tokens\). Bonds take roughly 15 epochs to vest; during that period, the OHM the user is due is slowly released to them. Bonds help the protocol accumulate and lock liquidity.

## How to Bond

First, go to Sushiswap and add liquidity. If you do not know how to do so, there is a good guide here. Next, come to our [website](http://olympusdao.finance/#/bond). Make sure "Bond" is selected. Type in the amount of SLP you would like to bond, then click Approve and sign the transaction. Next, click Bond and sign that transaction. **Please note that bonding takes two transactions; approve and bond.**

## **How to Redeem**

Come to our [website](http://olympusdao.finance/#/bond) and select the "Redeem" tab at the top of the window. Click "Redeem" to claim all of your available rewards.

## Reading the Info

**Balance** is your balance of SLP tokens. This is the asset used to create a bond.

**Bond Price** is the price of OHM through bonds. You can calculate the bond price as:
\(Value of your SLP token / OHM you'll get from the bond\).

**Market Price** is the market price of OHM.

**You Will Get** tells you how many OHM you will get from bonding the chosen amount of SLP.

**Debt Ratio** is the total amount of OHM created from bonds that have yet to pay out. The debt ratio is \(OHM created from unredeemed bonds / OHM total supply\).

**Vesting Term** is the length that a bond takes to fully redeem. This number is in blocks. 33110 blocks is approximately 5 days or 15 epochs.

**Discount** is the difference between the bond price and the market price. In the photo above, bonding would give you a 10.63% discount versus buying on the market at that same moment.
