# Bonds

Bonds allow users to buy OHM from the protocol at a discount by trading it with i) liquidity \(SLP tokens\) or ii) DAI. Bonds take roughly 15 epochs to vest, and OHM tokens are vested linearly to the user over that period. SLP bond helps the protocol accumulate and lock liquidity, while DAI bond allows the protocol to grow its treasury faster.

## How to Bond

First, go to Sushiswap and add liquidity. If you do not know how to do so, there is a good guide [here](https://help.sushidocs.com/guides/how-to-add-tokens-to-sushiswap-exchange-as-an-lp). Next, come to our [website](http://olympusdao.finance/#/bond). Make sure "Bond" is selected. Type in the amount of SLP you would like to bond, then click Approve and sign the transaction. Next, click Bond and sign that transaction. **Please note that bonding takes two transactions; approve and bond.**

## **How to Redeem**

Come to our [website](http://olympusdao.finance/#/bond) and select the "Redeem" tab at the top of the window. Click "Redeem" to claim all of your available rewards.

## Reading the Info

**Balance** is your balance of SLP tokens. This is the asset used to create a bond.

**Bond Price** is the price of OHM through bonds. You can calculate the bond price as:   
\(Value of your SLP token / OHM you'll get from the bond\).

**Market Price** is the market price of OHM.

**You Will Get** tells you how many OHM you will get from bonding the chosen amount of SLP.

**Debt Ratio** is the total amount of OHM created from bonds that have yet to pay out. The debt ratio is \(OHM created from unredeemed bonds / OHM total supply\).

**Vesting Term** is the length that a bond takes to fully redeem. This number is in blocks. 33110 blocks is approximately 5 days or 15 epochs.

**Discount** is the difference between the bond price and the market price. In the photo above, bonding would give you a 10.63% discount versus buying on the market at that same moment.
