# OHM-FRAX LP Bond

OHM-FRAX LP bond was introduced on 11 June 2021. It allows you to trade [OHM-FRAX LP token](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x2dce0dda1c2f98e0f171de8333c3c6fe1bbf4877) in exchange for discounted OHM on Olympus.

## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have OHM-FRAX LP tokens in your wallet. You need to go to Uniswap and add liquidity for the [OHM-FRAX pool](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x2dce0dda1c2f98e0f171de8333c3c6fe1bbf4877) to acquire them.

2. Head to the [OHM-FRAX LP Bond page of the Olympus website](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/bonds/ohm_frax_lp). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.

3. Type in the amount of OHM-FRAX LP tokens you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of OHM you can purchase.

5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.
