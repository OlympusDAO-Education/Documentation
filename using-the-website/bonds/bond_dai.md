# DAI Bond

DAI bond was introduced on 21 April 2021. It allows you to trade [DAI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai) in exchange for discounted OHM on Olympus.

## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have DAI in your wallet. For example, you can [go to Sushiswap to swap for DAI](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=&outputCurrency=0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f) if you don't have any.

2. Head to the [DAI Bond page of the Olympus website](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/bonds/dai). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.

3. Type in the amount of DAI you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of OHM you can purchase.

4. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the Olympus contract to spend your DAI. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.
