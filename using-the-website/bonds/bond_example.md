If you want to buy a reserve bond, the steps are simpler: 
Simply buy the reserve asset (skip the steps in [Acquire OHM-wETH LP](#acquire-ohm-weth-lp)) and go directly to 
[buying the bonds](#buy-the-bond).

## Acquire OHM-wETH LP

1. Make sure you have OHM and wETH in equal usd amounts in your wallet. For example, you can [use matcha to swap for wETH](https://matcha.xyz/markets/1/0x64aa3364f17a4d01c6f1751fd97c2bd3d7e7f1d5/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) if you don't have any.

2. Head to the [bonds page](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/bonds) of the Olympus website.
