# CVX Bond

CVX bond was introduced on 15th November 2021. It allows you to trade [CVX](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/convex-finance) in exchange for discounted OHM on Olympus.

## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have CVX in your wallet. For example, you can [go to Sushiswap to swap for CVX](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=0x4e3fbd56cd56c3e72c1403e103b45db9da5b9d2b&outputCurrency=ETH) if you don't have any.

2. Head to the [CVX Bond page of the Olympus website](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/bonds/cvx). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.

3. Type in the amount of CVX you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of OHM you can purchase.

4. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the Olympus contract to spend your CVX. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.
