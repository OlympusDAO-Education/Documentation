# Unstake LP Tokens

OHM-DAI LP token staking has been deprecated as Olympus owns most of the liquidity now. [Staking rewards are no longer being paid](https://scattershot.page/#/olympusdao.eth/proposal/QmRhBupfD53yBothJ6EarEiL6ztVjSPSfTHRWEpVE7oq3g) to OHM-DAI LP stakers, and users are advised to unstake their OHM-DAI LP tokens from Olympus to prevent any opportunity cost.
