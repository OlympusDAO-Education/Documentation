# Staking

Sometimes, the Olympus website might not be accessible due to [hosting issues](https://twitter.com/FleekHQ/status/1416505712222609411). Fear not, you can still interact with the Olympus contracts to perform certain actions such as staking. In this guide, we will show you how to stake OHM tokens via [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

If you have never staked OHM before, there are two steps involved:

1. Approve the staking contract to spend your OHM tokens.

2. Stake your OHM tokens.

If you have staked OHM before, there is only one step to perform: Stake your OHM tokens.

## How to Approve OHM Spending via Etherscan

1. Go to the [Write Contract section of the OHM token contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x383518188c0c6d7730d91b2c03a03c837814a899#writeContract).

2. Check and ensure your selected network is "Ethereum Mainnet" in your wallet. Then press **Connect to Web3** to connect your wallet if you haven't done so.

3. Once it is connected, select the third option *approve*.

4. On the *spender (address)* field, we would fill in the [staking contract address](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/references/contracts#staking). Enter this value: **0xC8C436271f9A6F10a5B80c8b8eD7D0E8f37a612d**

5. On the *amount (uint256)* field, fill in this value: **1000000000000000000**

6. Click **Write**.

7. Sign the transaction on Metamask and wait for it to complete.
