# Unstaking

Sometimes, the Olympus website might not be accessible due to [hosting issues](https://twitter.com/FleekHQ/status/1416505712222609411). Fear not, you can still interact with the Olympus contracts to perform certain actions such as unstaking. In this guide, we will show you how to unstake sOHM tokens via [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

If you have never unstaked sOHM before, there are two steps involved:

1. Approve the staking contract to spend your sOHM tokens.

2. Unstake your sOHM tokens.

If you have unstaked sOHM before, there is only one step to perform: Unstake your sOHM tokens.

## How to Approve sOHM Spending via Etherscan

1. Go to the [Write Contract section of the sOHM token contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x04f2694c8fcee23e8fd0dfea1d4f5bb8c352111f#writeContract).

2. Check and ensure your selected network is "Ethereum Mainnet" in your wallet. Then press **Connect to Web3** to connect your wallet if you haven't done so.

3. Once it is connected, select the first option *approve*.

4. On the *spender (address)* field, we would fill in the [staking contract address](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/references/contracts#staking). Enter this value: **0xFd31c7d00Ca47653c6Ce64Af53c1571f9C36566a**

5. On the *amount (uint256)* field, fill in the amount of sOHM you would like the staking contract to spend on your behalf, and multiply it by 1e9. Alternatively, you can use [this calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vm48OCBnVh8uah0-3Xa7HqFwmfxgcrMIWPrOllSFIvA/edit?usp=sharing) to perform the conversion for you. If you don't want to repeat this step whenever you want to unstake, you can choose a very large value. Let's say you want to allow the contract to spend up to 1e9 sOHM on your behalf, you would enter: **1000000000000000000**

6. Click **Write**.

7. Sign the transaction on Metamask and wait for it to complete.
