# Economic Productivity in Digital Economy

## Abstract

OlympusDAO is the first organization to explicitly realize and implement the idea
that, in digital economy, internal coordination is more significant than price
coordination. This is succinctly expressed in the (3, 3) versus (1, 1) game theory
meme. In digital economy, the dynamics of internal coordination versus price coordination
are the fundamental economic forces, as opposed to the older notions of supply
versus demand (which only describe price coordination). In the older style of industrial
production, price coordination (supply and demand) was the primary motivator for
starting a business. One would start a business in order to profit from price inefficiencies.
And from this primary motivation, would then organize internal coordination
around the productive task. By contrast, in digital economy, internal coordination
is the primary motivator, and only if internal coordination is significant enough,
can price coordination come into the picture through network effects. The dynamics
of internal coordination versus price coordination were first pointed out by Ronald
Coase in his essay [The Nature of the Firm](http://lib.cufe.edu.cn/upload_files/other/4_20140515034803_1%20Coase,%20R.H.%EF%BC%881937%EF%BC%89%20The%20Nature%20of%20the%20Firm.pdf)
(1937).

In the materials economy, what is being produced are tangible, finite supply goods.
And in that context, price coordination determines the optimal distribution of
those goods. But in digital economy, price coordination cannot determine the optimal
distribution of what is being produced, because what is being produced are ideas,
incentives, and infrastructures, which are not tangible or finite supply in the
same way. Price is only one *kind* of idea, incentive, and infrastructure, and not
necessarily the most predictive or determinate motivating factor. And therefore
internal coordination is more important than price coordination in digital economy.
It is only once a certain threshold of internal coordination is reached that the
economic productivity of ideas is then externalized into price coordination.

The idea that internal coordination is more significant than price coordination
is expressed very concisely in the (3, 3) meme. The (3, 3) is one outcome in a game
theoretic payoff matrix that describes the incentive structure of OlympusDAO. The
(3, 3) is a win-win situation in which both players stake their OHM tokens; this
is internal coordination. The (1, 1) payoff is also a win-win situation, to a lesser
degree, which happens when a buyer purchases OHM tokens from the protocol at a
discount, and provides another asset (a stable coin or LP token) to the protocol
treasury in return; this is price coordination. The (3, 3) meme basically expresses
the idea that internal coordination- universally agreed upon, positive sum, cooperative
behavior- is more economically productive than price coordination- divisive, zero
sum, competitive behavior. Price coordination (supply and demand) is still a win-win
equilibrium, just to a lesser degree than the internal coordination equilibrium.

In order to have an adequate theory of economic productivity in digital economy,
we must have a good description and explanation of internal coordination or (3, 3),
and a good explanation of exactly why it is more significant than price coordination
(1, 1). In order to do this, we look at the history of economic theories of value.
We show that value and productivity in digital economy, first fully realized and
expressed in OlympusDAO, is a certain kind of synthesis of prior value theories.
