# Introduction

## Summary

Olympus Pro is the new industry-standard service to help protocols acquire their own liquidity. Protocols no longer need to pay out high incentives to rent liquidity, while also guaranteeing the permanence of liquidity to facilitate transactions.

> Olympus Pro solves for liquidity problems by providing bonds-as-a-service for a small fee.

## Liquidity Problems 101

Today, protocols set aside a large percentage of their token supply in order to incentivize liquidity providers. This negatively impacts the sustainability of the protocol in these ways:

**1. Significant Sell Pressure:** Inflationary token emission incentivizes short-term behavior that increases sell pressure on the farm tokens. Mercenary liquidity providers \(LPs\) often sell their rewards to recoup their investments. Current solutions, such as time-locked staking, don't solve the core issue at hand and simply prolong the liquidity attrition.

**2. Goal Misalignment between Protocol and LP:** LPs are incentivized by high reward rates, rather than a strong belief in the success of the protocol. Hence, once the LP rewards are exhausted, the LPs will remove their capital and move on to the next opportunity.

**3. Impermanent Loss \(IL\):** The success of a protocol causes price appreciation in its native token, causing a significant impermanent loss scenario for liquidity providers. This misalignment disincentivizes long-term LPs, even if they're long-term believers in the protocol.  

**4: No Buyer of Last Resort:** During a market crash or in times of uncertainty, LPs tend to remove their liquidity from the pool as they are wary of the market state. It's at these moments, however, that the protocol needs liquidity the most.

## Benefits of Olympus Pro for Protocols

Why is Olympus Pro superior to traditional liquidity retention approaches?

**1. Protocols now own their liquidity,** rather than relying on mercenary LPs. This ensures permanence of liquidity and provides security for the protocol and its users.

2. As more liquidity is accumulated, the pool can support larger trades and guarantee **price stability** and **protection from massive liquidity exits.** This in turn creates a healthy price action, attracting long-term holders.

3. Protocols can unlock **new revenue streams** by capturing liquidity fees as they also become the liquidity providers themselves.

4. Protocols through their Olympus Pro partnership **gain extra exposure** as their bonds will be featured on Olympus Pro X, a unified marketplace for bonds.

5. Protocols gain access to **experienced policy and engineering teams** who provide market expertise and ensure success from deployment to maintenance.

## Benefits of Olympus Pro for the Community

Community plays an important role in the sustainability of a protocol. Olympus Pro offers the community:

**1. Opportunities to buy discounted tokens**. Long-term holders do not need to speculate on price action in order to obtain more tokens. Through bonds, they can supply LP tokens to the protocol of their choice in exchange for its native tokens at a discounted rate. This is a win-win scenario for both the token holders and the protocol itself.

**2. No exposure** **to impermanent loss.** Long-term holders aren't incentivized to provide liquidity, as they would experience impermanent loss. Shifting this loss to the protocol better aligns both LPs and the protocol.

**3. Confidence in the liquidity availability.** The community can be assured that the liquidity will permanently reside within the protocol and that there will always be ample liquidity for users to trade their tokens.

## Olympus: Pioneering POL in DeFi

Olympus introduced the concept of [protocol owned liquidity \(POL\)](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/references/glossary#pol) via its bond mechanism. Within 5 months, Olympus has amassed a super-majority \(+99.7%\) of the liquidity of its two main trading pools. As a result, the OHM-DAI pool has become the 13th largest pool within the Sushiswap ecosystem, with a ±2% slippage of $750k \(as of September 15th\).

Most interestingly, the accumulated liquidity also serves as a productive asset. In **less than 6 months**, Olympus has generated **over $3M in LP fees** alone!
