# Bonding

## What is Bonding?

**Bonding is a mechanism in which a user can sell assets to a protocol in exchange for its native token.**

To incentivize users to sell to the protocol, rather than the open market, bonds are offered at a discounted rate. Bonds also have a vesting period to prevent users from selling all the discounted tokens at once for a quick profit.  
  
Bond price is determined by the supply and demand of bonds. It trends higher when there is more demand. As a result, bonding is a very competitive space - bonders compete with each other to grab the largest discount.

Bond price can also be controlled by [BCV](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/references/glossary#bcv) \(Bond Control Variable\). It is a parameter set by the policy team to adjust bond capacity. When BCV increases, bond price increases, thus resulting in a smaller bond capacity.

As mentioned earlier, bonds are linearly vested over a period of time \(5 days by default\) to reduce sell pressure due to arbitrages.

## **What are the Benefits of Bonding?** 

**Bonding allows a protocol to accumulate their own liquidity.**  

* **Protocol Owned Liquidity** \(POL\) guarantees users that there is always sufficient liquidity for normal market operation. In other protocols, in case of a bank run, liquidity is often pulled from the protocol, exacerbating the situation with less exit liquidity.  
* **POL transforms liquidity from a liability to a revenue source.** Every swap transaction in a pool contributes a 0.3%/0.25% \(Uniswap/Sushiswap\) fee to the LPs. As liquidity is permanently locked in the treasury, these fees provide a constant source of revenue for the protocol. 
* **POL allows for additional yield farming opportunities.** For example, Sushiswap offers [the Onsen program](https://docs.sushi.com/products/yield-farming/what-is-onsen), where protocols could have their liquidity pair listed for SUSHI rewards. Once successfully listed, the protocols could deposit their SLP tokens into the Onsen menu and farm SUSHI tokens.
