Every contributor should follow this workflow when updating the documentation. At a high level, the workflow is as follows:

1. Clone the GitHub repository onto your local machine.
2. Create a local development branch.
3. Push your branch to the repository.
4. Perform your work in the local branch.
5. Commit your changes and push them to the remote branch regularly as your work progresses.
6. When the development is complete, submit a pull request on Github.

If you are not familiar with GitHub, check out [this guide from GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

### First-Time Setup

1. Clone [OlympusDAO-Education/Documentation](https://github.com/OlympusDAO-Education/Documentation) GitHub repository.

    `git clone git@github.com:OlympusDAO-Education/Documentation.git`

2. Go to the project directory where you have cloned the repository and issue this command:

    `git status`

3. You should see the following output in your terminal:

    > On branch master<br>
    > Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
    >
    > nothing to commit, working tree clean

4. You have now successfully cloned the GitHub repository and you can start making changes locally.
