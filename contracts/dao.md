# DAO

## DAO

The DAO contract is an address guarded by a simple gnosis safe implementation. The DAO address holds all the DAO funds accumulated over time. For instance the DAO receives OHM from every bond sold by the protocol. The DAO address also holds funds from strategic investments like pKLIMA acquired during a strategic partnership with KlimaDAO. Below are listed DAO addresses by version, where the latest version represents the currently active address.

The DAO contract is guarded by a 2 of 4 multisig. That means any transaction for making DAO changes must be approved by at least 2 signers, of which we have 4 signers in total. The operation security for our DAO is thus protected from a single actor going rogue, because it takes a quorum of 2 to authorize any transaction like engaging in DAO swaps. Note that DAO and treasury are guarded by the same signers. The 4 signing addresses for the DAO are listed below.
