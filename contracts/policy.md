The policy contract is guarded by a 3 of 5 multisig. That means any transaction
for making policy changes must be approved by at least 3 signers, of which we
have 5 signers in total. The operation security for our monetary policy is thus
protected from a single actor going rogue, because it takes a quorum of 3 to
authorize any transaction like adjusting the reward rate. Note that policy and
treasury are guarded by the same signers. The 5 signing addresses for our
monetary policy are listed below.
