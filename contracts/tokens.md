# Historical Tokens

The tokens below are only relevant if you've had OHM from the genesis block.  They're still of interest to everyone.

## aOHM

When OlympusDAO first launched, alphaOHM \(aOHM\) was used as a pre-allocation token which allowed the early participants to lay claim to OHM. Moving forward aOHM will serve as the in-game currency of [Alpha Omega](https://medium.com/@alpha_omega/alpha-omega-a-tale-of-two-cities-80a94966376b), a community-led social game that runs on the blockchain. Other than that aOHM is not relevant to OHM or the operation of OlympusDAO. Below are listed aOHM contracts by version, where the latest version represents the currently active contract.
