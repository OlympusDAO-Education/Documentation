## aOHM

When OlympusDAO first launched, alphaOHM (aOHM) was used as a pre-allocation
token which allowed the early participants to lay claim to OHM. Moving forward
aOHM will serve as the in-game currency of [Alpha Omega](https://medium.com/@alpha_omega/alpha-omega-a-tale-of-two-cities-80a94966376b),
a community-led social game that runs on the blockchain. Other than that aOHM is
