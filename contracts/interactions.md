# Contract Interactions

Olympus has numerous contracts that work together to provide the required functions of the currency: staking, bonds, tokens, treasury allocation.

The diagram below illustrates the interactions between each contract on Ethereum mainnet.

    The image embed tags are wrapped in a link, as GitBook's default behaviour is to open
    a linked image in its own media viewer. This breaks the embedded links within the SVG
    file. A workaround is to link to the SVG file, so it opens in its own screen, enabling
    the user to click on contract names.
