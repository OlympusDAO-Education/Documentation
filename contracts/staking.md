# Staking Contracts

## Distributor

The distributor contract receives minted OHM from the treasury in order to
drip-feed rewards to stakers. The reward rate target as of time of writing is
set to 3500, which translates to 0.35% of total supply, since the reward rate is
defined in tens of thousands. Note that the reward rate determines the rebase
rate and that the rebase rate determines the APY. Below are listed distributor
contracts by version, where the latest version represents the currently active
contract.

## Staking

Prior to the migration of the staking contract, the old staking contract
([0x0822...74A2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0822F3C03dcc24d200AFF33493Dc08d0e1f274A2))
was used for staking OHM. If users are still staked in there they should migrate
their staked OHM to the new staking contract
([0xFd31....566a](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFd31c7d00Ca47653c6Ce64Af53c1571f9C36566a)).
The new staking contract works with a staking helper contract
([0xC8C4....612d](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC8C436271f9A6F10a5B80c8b8eD7D0E8f37a612d)).
The staking helper contract calls "stake" and then "claim" of the new staking
contract. When the "stake" function is called, sOHM is put into a warmup phase
and all the information about how much sOHM a user has staked is stored in the
new staking contract. When the "claim" function is called, sOHM is retrieved
from the warmup and then sent to the user's wallet.
