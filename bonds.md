# Bonds

## What are bonds?

**Bonds are our secondary strategy. They provide a more conservative and reliable return.** Bonds are a cross between a fixed income product, a futures contract, and an option. 

The protocol quotes the bonder with terms for a trade at a future date. These terms include a defined amount of OHM the bonder will receive and the time when vesting is complete. The bond becomes redeemable as it vests. I.e. 2 days in 40% of the reward can be claimed.

**This allows Olympus to accumulate its own liquidity.** Doing so ensure there's always locked liquidity in the pool to facilitate market operations and protect token holders.

# Bonds

Bonds allow users to buy OHM from the protocol by trading it for DAI or previously staked liquidity \(SLP Tokens\). Bonds are sold at a discount and take roughly 15 epochs to vest (ca 5 days); 
The bonded OHM is released to the user linearly during the vesting period. Bonds help the protocol accumulate and lock in reliable liquidity.

## How to Bond

DAI Bonds: You can purchase bonded OHM using DAI. Go to our [website](http://olympusdao.finance/#/bond) and make sure "Bond" is selected. Type in the amount of DAI that you would like to bond, then click "Approve" and sign the transaction. As it is finished, make sure you enter the same amount of DAI an click Bond, then sign the transaction. 

SLP Bonds: In order to pay for the bond you need a corresponding amount of SLP tokens to pay with and you can get them from Sushiswap. If you are unfamiliar with the process, there is a good guide hereLINKLINKLINK. Next, come to our [website](http://olympusdao.finance/#/bond) and make sure "Bond" is selected. Type in the amount of SLP that you would like to bond, then click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

## Reading the Info

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

**Balance** is your balance of SLP tokens. This is the asset used to create a bond.

**Bond Price** is the price of bonded OHM. You can calculate the bond price as:   
\(Value of your SLP token / OHM you'll get from the bond\).

**Market Price** is the market price of OHM.

**You Will Get** tells you how many OHM you will get from bonding the chosen amount of SLP.

**Debt Ratio** is the total amount of OHM created from bonds that have yet to pay out. The debt ratio is \(OHM created from unredeemed bonds / OHM total supply\).

**Vesting Term** is the time that a bond takes to fully redeem. This number is in blocks. 33110 blocks is approximately 5 days or 15 epochs.

**Discount** is the difference between the bond price and the market price. In the photo above, bonding would give you a 10.63% discount versus buying on the market at that same moment.
