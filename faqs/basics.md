### Why do we need OlympusDAO in the first place?

Crypto is an emerging digital economy in the early stages of a multi-decade economic boom. Dollar-pegged stablecoins dominate crypto and the dollar is controlled by FED. By using these stablecoins, we have given up crypto’s monetary sovereignty and opened crypto up to external dependencies that introduce systemic risks. While that was a logical risk to take in the early days, as we march towards mainstream adoption we should be aiming to regain sovereignty in the form of crypto’s own cross-chain protocol-controlled currency system.

### OHM is backed, not pegged.

Each OHM is backed by DAI, not pegged to it. This means OHM can never trade below 1 DAI because the treasury backs every OHM with at least 1 DAI. It could trade above 1 DAI because there is no cap imposed by the protocol.

You might say that OHM floor price or intrinsic value is 1 DAI. We believe that the actual price will always be 1 DAI + premium, but in the end that is up to the market to decide.

### How does it work?

At a high level, OlympusDAO consists of protocol managed treasury, protocol owned liquidity, bond mechanism, and high staking rewards that are designed to control supply expansion.
