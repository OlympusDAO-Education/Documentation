## FAQs

**Why do we need OlympusDAO in the first place?**

Crypto is an emerging digital economy in the early stages of a multi-decade economic boom. Dollar-pegged stablecoins dominate crypto and the dollar is controlled by FED so basically we have given up crypto’s monetary sovereignty and opened crypto up to external dependencies that introduce systemic risk. While that was a logical risk to take in the early days, as we march towards mainstream adoption we should be aiming to regain sovereignty in the form of crypto’s own cross chain policy-controlled currency system.

**Backed not pegged.**

Pegged == 1. Backed >= 1. OHM is backed by DAI, not pegged to it. Treasury backs every OHM with at least 1 DAI.

You might say that OHM floor price or intrinsic value is 1 DAI. We believe that the actual price will always be 1 DAI + premium or treasury value + premium in the future, but in the end that is up to the market to decide.

**How does it work?**

At a high level, OlympusDAO consists of protocol managed treasury, protocol owned liquidity, bond mechanism, and high staking rewards that are designed to control supply expansion.
