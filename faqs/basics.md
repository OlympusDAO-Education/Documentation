**Why do we need Olympus in DAO in the first place?**

Crypto is an emerging digital economy in the early stages of a multi-decade economic boom. Dollar-pegged stablecoins dominate crypto and the dollar is controlled by FED so basically we have given up crypto’s monetary sovereignty and opened crypto up to external dependencies that introduce systemic risk. While that was a logical risk to take in the early days, as we march towards mainstream adoption we should be aiming to regain sovereignty in the form of crypto’s own cross chain policy-controlled currency system.
