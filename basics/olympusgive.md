# Olympus Give

## What is Olympus Give?

Olympus Give allows stakers to redirect their rebase rewards either to pre-selected
charity causes or to any wallet of their choosing (e.g. a friend or family member).

## How do I take part?

When Olympus Give goes live, you can follow these steps to set up the donation:

1. [Acquire sOHM tokens](../using-the-website/staking.md).
They earn you rebase rewards that can be redirected to the causes.

2. Head over to the Give section of the Olympus App.

3. In the “My Donations” tab, you’ll be able to see a number of causes which we
have partnered with.

4. You can also donate to any **verified wallet** of your choosing - family, friends,
or organizations in your community.

5. Once you have selected a recipient, determine the sOHM amount that you wish to
pledge/deposit into the Give Pool for that recipient.

6. The recipient will receive all the rebase rewards from the pledged tokens
**indefinitely** --- until you withdraw your principle from the pool.

## What are the causes I can donate to?

**Angel Protocol’s Restore Earth, ImpactMarket, Gitcoin, Popcorn, and Kolektivo**.
These are the Cohort 1 partners which were chosen due to their crypto nativeness
and their reputation in managing donated funds. In the future, partner selection
may move towards being fully community-driven.
