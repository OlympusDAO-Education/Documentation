# V2 Migration

## Why do I need to migrate?
You don't have to, but we recommend you to do so. V2 migration introduces new
features such as on-chain governance and auto-staking for bonds. You can read
more about this on the [Olympus Medium page](https://olympusdao.medium.com/introducing-olympus-v2-c4ade14e9fe).

## Gas fees are high now, will I lose my rebase rewards if I delay the migration?
No, you can migrate at your leisure once it goes live. The smart contract will
keep track of your entitled rebase rewards so you wouldn't miss any of them.

## What if I don't migrate?
You don't get to enjoy the new features introduced by V2. Some partners such as
Rari Capital will only accept V2 tokens once they are deployed, so you would
need to migrate if you want to spend more tokens (e.g. make new deposits) on these
platforms.
