# Staking

## What is Staking

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Olympus.** Stakers stake their OHM on [the Olympus website](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/stake) to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceed from [bond sales](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/basics/bonding), and can vary based on the number of OHM staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your stake of OHM translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of OHM drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your staked OHM balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

**When you stake, you lock OHM and receive an equal amount of sOHM.** Your sOHM balance rebases up automatically at the end of every epoch. sOHM is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you burn sOHM and receive an equal amount of OHM.** Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked OHM \(if any\) will continue to receive rebase rewards.
