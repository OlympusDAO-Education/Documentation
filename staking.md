# Staking

## What is Staking

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Olympus.** Stakers lock and take on exposure to OHM and in return receive a fee on all OHM sold or purchased. Stakers receive those profits through rebases to the sOHM token. This allows us to compound yield automatically.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increases in your stake of OHM translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. Since the backing of OHM effectively shifts the floor for the token from zero to one, stakers can be rebased into a risk-free position. 

**When you stake, you lock OHM and receive an equal amount of sOHM.** Your sOHM balance rebases up automatically at the end of every epoch. sOHM is transferrable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you burn sOHM and receive an equal amount of OHM.** Unstaking also requires the user to forfeit the most recent rebase as an exit fee.
