# Introduction

## What is Olympus?

Olympus is an algorithmic currency protocol based on the $OHM token. It introduces unique economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through asset-backing and protocol owned value.

## What is the point of Olympus?

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behavior of the $OHM token is controlled at a high level by the DAO. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that $OHM can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.

## How do I participate in Olympus?

There are two main strategies for market participants: staking and bonding. Stakers lock supply and receive a share of protocol profits as they are earned. Bonders provide locked liquidity and receive a fixed profit after a fixed period of time.

Governance participants can get involved on our forum and through discussions on our discord. We are always looking for new community members to contribute!

## How can I benefit from Olympus?

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol takes a sizeable fee on all supply expansion, which is distributed primarily to stakers. Most gains for stakers will come from compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration.

The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in $OHM and thus depends on price. Bonders benefit from a rising or static price.

## Who created Olympus?

Olympus was ideated by Zeus and built by a distributed psuedo-anonymous team.

## Who runs Olympus?

No one. Olympus is DAO-governed. All decisions are formed by community members on the forum and made by token holders through snapshot voting.
